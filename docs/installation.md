# Installtion

Installing **ContextMenu** is just as easy as every other JavaScript library. To deep-dive into the full potential of this small javascript library, and script the most responsive and functional contextmenu on the web, an installation needs to be done.

  1. Clone the repository and look for the `contextmenu.js` file in the dist folder. This process is as simple as running:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/calebpitan/contextmenu.git
  ```
  A `contextmenu` folder would be created in the directory where you ran this and all files in this repository would be accessible thereon.

  2. Install from npm.
  ```bash
  npm install --save @calebpitan/contextmenu
  ```
  This installs contextmenu locally and saves it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.
